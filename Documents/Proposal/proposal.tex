\maketitle

The purpose of this project is to show that a Neural Network can be trained to detect and match features between images. Ever since Google released Tensorflow in 2015, it has been implemented for a wide range of applications. Matching features between images can sometimes be obvious for a human, however, when trying to write an algorithm to do this is not so easy. Computers require strong logic, and the information an image gives can be chaotic making it hard to discern an appropriate procedure that works for a wide range of images.
